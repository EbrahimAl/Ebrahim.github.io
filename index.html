        </h4>
        <p class="H">Seven plus years of war have left entire Syrian cities in rubble. Numbers aren’t clear yet but it’s been estimated that rebuilding the country would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 billion dollars.</p>
        <p class="P">UNOSAT data was collected by visually inspecting high-resolution satellite imagery captured between September 2013 and November 2017. Detected damaged structures are assigned one of four categories: 1) moderately damaged, 2) severely damaged, 3) destroyed, or 4) no visible damage. Eight of Syria’s largest cities were assessed, namely Aleppo, Damascus, Daraa, Deir ez Zor, Hama, Homs, Idlib and Raqqa (Figure 1). Assessment was repeated different times for different cities. Data is made available for download in shapefile and geodatabase formats.</p>
